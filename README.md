# Alpha Order

This project is to understand if the classical alphabet is best taught in the classical order. There doesn't appear to be any strategic reason for the ordering of the English alphabet and it is likely to have been ordered through a convention long forgotten.

Knowledge of this could potentially affect how the alphabet would be taught and have an influence on the learning order of other writing systems.

## Word Utilization Quality
Learning to read the 26 characters of the alphabet for an adult isn't a significant task as compared to a two year old as they have more experience in learning. To assist the two year old learner, we can define a measure of quality of an alphabet order as the ability to put the individual letters into context by the use of words already known. As an example the letter order of *XUL* would be considered poor quality due to the inability to make any words from it. Whereas the letter order of *ADY* would be considered higher quality because more words such as 'add', 'day', 'daddy' can be assembled from it.

### Exp1
A basic letter frequency analysis of vocabulary provides a better alphabet order than the classical alphabet.

1. Gather a vocabulary list from a two year old(2yov).
2. Build a letter frequency table from the vocabulary.
3. Order the alphabet using the frequency table.
4. Graph the relationship of number of letters in this alphabet order to how many words can be utilized.
5. Graph the same as above but using the classical alphabet.

### Exp2
Grouping and determining the frequency of letter pairs will yield better results than the basic frequency or classical alphabet.

1. Using 2yov split all words into pairs eg. puppy = [pu, up, pp, py]
2. Sort each pair and remove any pair that are duplicates or are the same letter. [pu, pu, pp, py] => [pu, py]
3. Build a frequency table of pairs.
4. Order the alphabet using the frequency table and split the pairs into single letters.
5. Graph and compare to classical alphabet.
