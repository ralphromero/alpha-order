# Alpha Order

This project is to understand if there is a more optimal order to learn the English alphabet in the context of my two year old daughter.

## What it Does
It will generate a sequence of alphabet letters through different methods and plot a graph comparing them.

## How to Run
To run the program just use ```python AlphaOrder.py```. Go and have dinner and come back when it's done because the genetic algorithm will need time to complete.
