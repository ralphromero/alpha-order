# Alpha Order

This project is my attempt to understand if there is a more optimal sequence by which I should teach my daughter the alphabet characters. The alphabet is taught in the classical order of abcd.... but what if this order wasn't designed for efficiency.
Starting from words that my daughter knows, we will build a customized alphabet learning order.

# Process
1. Gather a list of words that my daughter knows.
2. Split each word into 2 letter pairs.
3. Build a frequency table of these pairs.
4. Output the letters of these pairs starting from highest to lowest frequency.
